# EasyConfig Azure Web App extension

> provided by [codez.one](https://codez.one)

## Introduction

An endpoint for SPA client apps hosted in an Azure Web App to get configuration values stored in environment variables or Azure KeyVault.

If a Single Page Application hosted in an Azure Web App needs configuration values that are only known in a deployed environment it can get a little tricky. A good example is the URI for an API endpoint used by the client app or details for a client-side authentication like MSAL. These values are known at deployment time and can be set as settings in the Web App. But the only way to access these values from the client is having server-side code that can read the values and provide them to the client.  

This extension will take care on that and after installation you will get an endpoint like that:

```
https://easyconfigsiteextension.azurewebsites.net/.config/environment.json
```

The response looks like:

```json
{
    "section":
    {
        "setting": "value"
    },
    "setting1": "value 1"
}
```
